- [`contours.ipynb`](contours.ipynb) tools and features in relation to contours.
- [`draw.ipynb`](draw.ipynb) drawing approaches.
- [`marker-based-segmentation.ipynb`](marker-based-segmentation.ipynb) labels which pixels belong to which regions.
- [`tesseract-orc.ipynb`](tesseract-orc.ipynb) ORC.
- [`utils.py`](utils.py) custom tools.
- [ML](ML) machine learning folder.
    - [pytorch-lenet.ipynb](pytorch-lenet.ipynb) end-to-end how to develop LeNet model using PyTorch.
    - [shape-recognition-lenet.ipynb](ML/shape-recognition-lenet.ipynb) apply ReNet to recognize shapes.
    - [keras-object-localization.ipynb](ML/keras-object-localization.ipynb) single object localization.
